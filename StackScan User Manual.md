## **3. Configuration**

### **Overview of Configuration File (`stackscan.conf`)**
The `~/stackscan.conf` file is the core configuration file for StackScan. It allows you to customize the behavior of the scans, including Nmap options, Wapiti options, Nikto options, and more.

### **Detailed Configuration Options**

#### **Nmap Options**
- **NMAP_OPTIONS**: General options for Nmap scans, e.g., `-Pn -sC -A -sV -sS`.

#### **Wapiti Options**
- **WAPITI_OPTIONS**: Options to configure the scope and depth of Wapiti web vulnerability scans.

#### **Nikto Options**
- **NIKTO_OPTIONS**: Options for running Nikto scans, such as SSL settings and verbosity levels.

#### **Group-Specific Scripts and Arguments**
- **WEB_NMAP_SCRIPTS**: Define the Nmap scripts for web scans, e.g., `http-enum`, `http-vuln*`.
- **WEB_NMAP_SCRIPT_ARGS**: Arguments specific to the Nmap scripts used in web scans.

#### **Port Definitions by Group**
- **WEB_PORTS**: Ports to scan in the web group, e.g., `80,443,8080,8443`.

### **Modifying the Configuration File**
To modify the `stackscan.conf` file, open it in any text editor:
```sh
nano ~/.stackscan.conf
```
Adjust the parameters as needed and save the file.

### **Example Configurations**
Below is an example configuration for a typical web and database server environment:

```plaintext
NMAP_OPTIONS="-Pn -sC -A -sV -sS"
WEB_NMAP_SCRIPTS=("http-enum" "http-vuln*" "http-wordpress*")
WEB_NMAP_SCRIPT_ARGS=("http-wordpress-enum.threads=10" "http-wordpress-brute.threads=10")
WEB_PORTS="80,443,8080,8443"
```

### **Full Default Configuration**
For a full breakdown of the default configuration file, please refer to [Appendix A](#appendix-a-full-default-configuration-file).

---

## **4. Running Scans**

### **Command-Line Options**

#### **Target Specification**
Specify the target server's IP address or domain name:
```sh
sudo ./stackscan.sh <target>
```

#### **Verbose Mode**
Enable verbose output for detailed logging:
```sh
sudo ./stackscan.sh -v <target>
```

#### **Output Options**
- **Log File**: The scan results are saved in a log file named after the target and timestamp.
- **HTML Report**: An HTML report is generated summarizing the scan results.

### **Scan Types**

#### **Web Scans**
Focuses on HTTP/HTTPS services, identifying vulnerabilities in web servers and applications.

#### **Auth Scans**
Targets authentication services like SSH and FTP to detect potential weaknesses in authentication mechanisms.

#### **Database Scans**
Scans database services (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

#### **Common Scans**
Covers widely-used services like DNS, SMB, and SSL, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

#### **Vulnerability Scans**
Utilizes Nmap's vulnerability scripts to identify known security issues.

### **Parallel and Grouped Scans**

#### **How Parallel Scanning Works**
StackScan runs multiple scans in parallel, significantly reducing the total time required to assess a target. This feature is particularly useful when scanning multiple services on a large network.

#### **Optimizing Scans for Performance**
To optimize scan performance, ensure that your system has adequate resources (CPU, RAM) and consider narrowing the scope of scans (e.g., limiting the number of ports or services).

### **Example Scenarios**

#### **Scanning a Web Server**
```sh
sudo ./stackscan.sh -v example.com
```
This command will perform a comprehensive scan of the web services hosted on `example.com`.

#### **Scanning a Database Server**
```sh
sudo ./stackscan.sh -v 192.168.1.100
```
This command will scan the database services running on the server at `192.168.1.100`.

#### **Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment**
For a full vulnerability assessment:
```sh
sudo ./stackscan.sh -v <target>
```
This will run all available scans in parallel, providing a thorough evaluation of the target's security posture.

## **5. Output and Reporting**

### **Understanding Console Output**
During the scan, StackScan provides real-time feedback in the console. This includes the status of each scan group and any detected vulnerabilities.

### **Log Files**

#### **Location and Structure**
Log files are saved in the same directory as the script, named after the target and timestamp, e.g., `127.0.0.1_20240826_114046_scan.log`.

#### **Log File Naming Conventions**
Log files follow the naming convention: `<target>_<date>_<time>_scan.log`, ensuring easy identification and organization.

### **HTML Reports**

#### **Report Structure**
HTML reports summarize the scan results, including:
- Overview of detected services
- Vulnerabilities with associated CVE details
- Recommendations for remediation

#### **Viewing Reports**
Reports can be viewed in any web browser. The file is saved in the same directory as the script and log file.

#### **Interpreting the Results**
The HTML report is divided into sections corresponding to each scan group. Each section provides details on detected services, open ports, and identified vulnerabilities.

### **CVE Lookups**

#### **How CVE Lookups Are Performed**
StackScan automatically queries the NVD for CVEs related to detected services and vulnerabilities. This information is included in the HTML report.

#### **Understanding CVE Information in Reports**
Each CVE entry includes:
- **CVE ID**: The unique identifier for the vulnerability.
- **Description**: A brief overview of the issue.
- **CVSS Score**: A numerical score representing the severity of the vulnerability.

## **6. Advanced Usage**

### **Custom Scan Groups**
Users can define additional scan groups in the configuration file. This allows for tailored scans that focus on specific services or vulnerabilities.

### **Custom Nmap Scripts and Arguments**
The `stackscan.conf` file allows you to specify custom Nmap scripts and arguments, enabling advanced users to fine-tune their scans.

### **Running Wapiti and Nikto Scans Concurrently**
StackScan runs Wapiti and Nikto scans concurrently across multiple ports, improving scan efficiency. This is particularly useful for large-scale web application assessments.

### **Integrating StackScan with Other Tools**
StackScan can be integrated into a larger security toolkit, using its output for further analysis with tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, or SIEM solutions.

**7. Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue**: Missing dependencies
**Solution**: Ensure all required tools (`nmap`, `wapiti`, `nikto`, etc.) are installed on your system.

#### **Issue**: Permission errors
**Solution**: Run the script with `sudo` to ensure it has the necessary permissions to perform scans.

### **Error Messages and What They Mean**

#### **Error**: "This script must be run as root."
**Meaning**: The script requires root privileges to perform certain actions. Run it with `sudo`.

#### **Error**: "Command not found: nmap"
**Meaning**: The `nmap` tool is not installed or not in the system's PATH. Install it using your package manager.

## **8. Best Practices**

### **Configuring Scans for Different Environments**
Customize the `stackscan.conf` file to suit your specific environment. For example, use different port ranges or Nmap scripts for web servers versus database servers.

### **Interpreting Results for Actionable Security Improvements**
Focus on high-severity vulnerabilities first. Use the CVSS scores and recommendations in the HTML report to prioritize remediation efforts.

### **Regular Use and Maintenance**
Regularly update the tools used by StackScan (`nmap`, `wapiti`, `nikto`) to ensure that scans incorporate the latest vulnerability checks. Schedule periodic scans to maintain your server's security posture.
